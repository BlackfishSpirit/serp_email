# Feature Tracking System

## Overview

This repository uses a comprehensive feature tracking system that integrates with GitHub Spec Kit for spec-driven development. The system provides:

- **Structured Feature Documentation**
- **Backlog Management**
- **Epic and Feature Tracking**
- **GitHub Spec Kit Integration**
- **Web Dashboard for Visual Management**

## Quick Start

### View Features Dashboard
```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Open dashboard in browser
http://localhost:3000/dev/features
```

### Command Line Management

```bash
# List all features
pnpm features:list

# Show project metrics
pnpm features:metrics

# Create a new feature manually
pnpm features:create "Feature Name" "Feature description" --priority high

# Create feature with GitHub Spec Kit integration
pnpm features:spec "Add user authentication with email/password login" --priority high

# Move feature to different status
pnpm features:move feat-001 active
```

## Directory Structure

└── scripts/

    └── spec-kit-integration.py # GitHub Spec Kit bridge
```

## Feature Lifecycle

### 1. Backlog → Planning
```bash
pnpm features:move feat-001 planning
```

### 2. Planning → Active
```bash
pnpm features:move feat-001 active
```

### 3. Active → Review
```bash
pnpm features:move feat-001 review
```

### 4. Review → Testing
```bash
pnpm features:move feat-001 testing
```

### 5. Testing → Complete
```bash
pnpm features:move feat-001 complete
```

## Spec-Driven Feature Development

### 1. Create Feature with GitHub Spec Kit
```bash
# This will:
# - Run GitHub Spec Kit to generate specifications
# - Create feature documentation
# - Add to backlog
# - Generate technical plan and tasks
pnpm features:spec "Add user dashboard with analytics and reporting"
```

### 2. Review Generated Specification
Check the created feature document in `docs/features/backlog/` for:
- Generated specification from GitHub Spec Kit
- Technical plan
- Breakdown of tasks
- Architecture recommendations

### 3. Implement with Claude Code
Use the generated specification and plan with Claude Code for implementation.

## Feature Templates

### Feature Template
Each feature uses a standardized template with:
- **Problem Statement** - What problem does this solve?
- **Solution Summary** - How are we solving it?
- **Success Criteria** - How do we measure success?
- **Technical Design** - Architecture and components
- **Implementation Plan** - Tasks and timeline
- **Testing Strategy** - How to verify it works

### Epic Template
For larger initiatives:
- **Vision Statement** - High-level goals
- **Business Value** - Why this matters
- **Feature Breakdown** - Individual features
- **Timeline & Milestones** - Project planning

## Web Dashboard Features

Access at `http://localhost:3000/dev/features`:

### Overview Tab
- **Metrics Cards** - Total features, active, completed, estimated hours
- **Progress Bar** - Overall completion rate
- **Recent Activity** - Latest feature updates

### Backlog Tab
- **Search & Filter** - Find features by name, status, tags
- **Feature Cards** - Visual representation of features
- **Quick Actions** - Create new features

### Active Tab
- **Current Work** - Features in progress, review, testing
- **Owner Assignment** - Who's working on what
- **Status Tracking** - Visual status indicators

### Epics Tab
- **Epic Overview** - High-level initiative tracking
- **Feature Grouping** - Related features under epics
- **Progress by Epic** - Completion tracking

## Integration Points

### GitHub Spec Kit
- Automatic specification generation
- Technical plan creation
- Task breakdown
- Integration with feature documentation

### Feature Documenter Agent
- Use the feature documenter agent for comprehensive documentation
- Creates detailed feature specs from basic descriptions

### Workflow Checklist
- Features integrate with the project workflow checklist
- Development tasks link to feature tracking

## Examples

### Creating a New Feature Manually
```bash
pnpm features:create \
  "Advanced Search" \
  "Full-text search with filters and sorting" \
  --priority high \
  --hours 20 \
  --tags search frontend api \
  --value high
```

### Creating with Spec-Driven Development
```bash
# Let GitHub Spec Kit generate the specification
pnpm features:spec "Add real-time chat support with AI assistance"

# Review generated documentation
# Implement using Claude Code
# Track progress through feature lifecycle
```

### Managing Feature Status
```bash
# Start working on a feature
pnpm features:move feat-003 active

# Move to review when implementation is done
pnpm features:move feat-003 review

# Complete after testing
pnpm features:move feat-003 complete
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Specification
- Use GitHub Spec Kit for complex features
- Define problem before solution
- Include success criteria

### 2. Keep Documentation Updated
- Move features through lifecycle stages
- Update documentation as you learn
- Link to relevant GitHub issues/PRs

### 3. Use Tags Effectively
- `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `ui`, `database`
- `seo`, `performance`, `security`, `accessibility`
- `integration`, `refactor`, `bug-fix`, `enhancement`

### 4. Prioritize Systematically
- **Critical**: Blocking other work, security issues
- **High**: Core functionality, user-facing features
- **Medium**: Improvements, optimizations
- **Low**: Nice-to-have, future considerations

### 5. Estimate Realistically
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Include time for testing and documentation
- Account for integration complexity

## Reporting & Analytics

### Command Line Metrics
```bash
pnpm features:metrics
```

### Web Dashboard Analytics
- Feature completion trends
- Velocity tracking
- Backlog health
- Epic progress

### Export Options
```bash
# Generate feature report
python .feature-tracking/scripts/feature-manager.py report

# Export to CSV
python .feature-tracking/scripts/feature-manager.py export --format csv
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Features not showing in dashboard:**
- Ensure development server is running (`pnpm dev`)
- Check backlog.json format
- Verify file permissions

**GitHub Spec Kit integration failing:**
- Confirm GitHub Spec Kit is installed (`pnpm specify:check`)
- Check Python environment
- Verify project structure

**Documentation not generating:**
- Check template files exist in `docs/features/templates/`
- Verify directory permissions
- Ensure feature ID is unique

### Getting Help

- Check feature tracking dashboard for visual overview
- Use `pnpm features:metrics` for current status
- Review generated documentation in `docs/features/`
- See `TEAM_SETUP.md` for general development workflow
