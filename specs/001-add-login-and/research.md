# Authentication Research: Clerk Integration

## Research Context
Based on technical context analysis, all major technology decisions are already determined:
- **Language/Framework**: TypeScript with Next.js 14.2.0
- **Auth Service**: Clerk (already in dependencies @clerk/nextjs 5.7.4)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing

## Key Research Findings

### Clerk Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use Clerk's Next.js App Router integration
**Rationale**:
- Native support for Next.js 14 App Router
- Built-in middleware for route protection
- Handles all auth requirements from spec (registration, login, password reset, session management)
- Supports custom session timeout configuration
- Email verification built-in with conditional access controls

**Alternatives considered**:
- NextAuth.js - More complex setup, less feature-complete
- Custom auth implementation - Security risks, significant development time
- Firebase Auth - Vendor lock-in, less TypeScript-native

### Session Management
**Decision**: Clerk's built-in session management with 30-minute timeout
**Rationale**:
- Clerk supports custom session timeout configuration
- Automatic token refresh and session validation
- Built-in session state management across pages
- Supports server-side session validation

**Implementation approach**:
- Configure session timeout in Clerk dashboard
- Use Clerk's `useAuth()` hook for client-side session state
- Implement middleware for server-side route protection

### Email Verification Strategy
**Decision**: Conditional verification using Clerk's verification features
**Rationale**:
- Clerk supports conditional email verification
- Can configure which features require verified emails
- Built-in email delivery and verification flow
- Customizable verification requirements per route/feature

**Implementation approach**:
- Configure basic features to allow unverified users
- Protect sensitive features with verification checks
- Use Clerk's `user.emailAddresses[0].verification.status` for checks

### Password Security
**Decision**: Leverage Clerk's password policy configuration
**Rationale**:
- Clerk enforces password complexity rules
- Built-in password strength validation
- Handles password reset flows securely
- Configurable password requirements

**Configuration**:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Require mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

### Route Protection
**Decision**: Next.js middleware with Clerk's auth helpers
**Rationale**:
- Runs at edge before page rendering
- Supports both client and server-side protection
- Integrates with Next.js App Router seamlessly
- Enables redirect to intended destination after login

**Implementation pattern**:
```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/sign-in", "/sign-up"],
  ignoredRoutes: ["/api/public"]
});
```

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-layer testing with Playwright and Clerk test helpers
**Rationale**:
- Clerk provides test utilities for mocking auth state
- Playwright handles E2E auth flows
- Can test both authenticated and unauthenticated states

**Testing layers**:
- Unit tests for auth utilities
- Integration tests for auth components
- E2E tests for complete auth flows

## Implementation Dependencies
- Clerk Dashboard configuration (session timeout, password policy)
- Environment variables setup (CLERK_SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- Middleware configuration for route protection
- Component library integration for auth UI

## Performance Considerations
- Clerk's edge-optimized authentication (~50ms typical auth check)
- Session validation cached at CDN level
- Automatic token refresh prevents auth interruptions
- Server-side session checks for sensitive operations

## Security Best Practices
- All auth operations handled by Clerk (reduces attack surface)
- HTTPS-only cookies for session tokens
- CSRF protection built into Clerk's implementation
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 failed attempts = lockout)
- Email deliverability verification prevents fake accounts

## Next Steps
All research complete - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain. Ready for Phase 1 design.
