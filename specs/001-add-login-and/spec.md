# Feature Specification: User Authentication with Clerk

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-login-and`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add login and authentication using clerk"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: login, authentication, Clerk service
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Should new user accounts require email verification before gaining access to the application? ‚Üí A: Conditional - Required for data export, payment processing, and admin functions; optional for dashboard viewing and basic profile management
- Q: What password complexity rules should be enforced during registration? ‚Üí A: Moderate - Minimum 8 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Q: How long should user sessions remain active, and what should happen when they expire? ‚Üí A: Short - 30 minutes idle, auto-logout with notification
- Q: What should happen when a user makes multiple failed login attempts? ‚Üí A: Lock account - Temporarily lock account after 5 failed attempts
- Q: What level of email validation should be applied during registration? ‚Üí A: Deliverability - Full verification including mailbox existence

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to securely access the application with their credentials to protect their personal data and maintain session continuity across visits. The system should provide a seamless authentication experience that allows users to sign up, log in, log out, and manage their account security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they choose to create an account, **Then** they should be able to register with valid credentials and gain immediate access
2. **Given** an existing user with valid credentials, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** they should be authenticated and redirected to their intended destination
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they log out, **Then** their session should be terminated and they should be redirected to a public page
4. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access protected content, **Then** they should be redirected to the login page
5. **Given** a user has forgotten their password, **When** they request a password reset, **Then** they should receive secure instructions to regain access

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to register with an already existing email address?
- How does the system handle login attempts with incorrect credentials?
- What occurs when a user's session expires while they're using the application?
- System temporarily locks accounts after 5 consecutive failed login attempts

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow new users to create accounts with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users with valid credentials
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to securely log out and terminate their session
- **FR-004**: System MUST protect restricted pages from unauthenticated access
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide password reset functionality for users who forgot their credentials
- **FR-006**: System MUST display appropriate error messages for invalid login attempts and temporarily lock accounts after 5 failed attempts
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain user session state across page navigation
- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect users to their intended destination after successful authentication
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate email deliverability including mailbox existence during registration
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce minimum 8 character passwords with mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- **FR-011**: System MUST require email verification for data export, payment processing, and administrative functions while allowing dashboard access, profile viewing, and basic navigation without verification
- **FR-012**: System MUST auto-logout users after 30 minutes of inactivity with notification

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Authentication operations MUST complete within 200ms
- **NFR-002**: API endpoints MUST respond within 100ms for GET requests, 200ms for mutations
- **NFR-003**: Session validation MUST complete within 50ms
- **NFR-004**: User interface MUST remain responsive during authentication flows
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle concurrent authentication requests without performance degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with authentication credentials, email address, and account status
- **User Session**: Represents an active authenticated session with session token, expiration time, and associated user
- **Authentication State**: Represents the current authentication status throughout the application with login status and user identity
