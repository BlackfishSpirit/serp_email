# Design Implementation Command

Implement the final design with full interactivity, animations, and functional elements using SuperDesign workflow.

## Usage
```
/design-implement "Implement the selected design with full interactivity. Add click animations, hover effects, and ensure all elements are functional."
```

## Prerequisites
1. Complete layout phase
2. Complete theme selection
3. Have final design selected

## Implementation Features
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable buttons, functional inputs
- **Animations**: Hover effects, click feedback, transitions
- **Responsiveness**: Multi-device compatibility
- **Functionality**: Form handling, navigation, interactions

## Animation Types
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle visual feedback
- **Click Animations**: Mechanical click responses
- **Transitions**: Smooth state changes
- **Loading States**: User feedback during actions

## Testing
SuperDesign provides real-time preview:
- Click all interactive elements
- Test form inputs
- Verify responsive behavior
- Check animation timing

## Next Steps
After implementation:
1. Convert to production framework (React/Next.js)
2. Integrate with component libraries (shadcn)
3. Apply custom themes (TweakCN)
4. Add to codebase

This command completes the SuperDesign workflow, creating fully functional prototypes ready for production conversion.
