# Design Agent Command

Launch the specialized design workflow agent for comprehensive front-end design guidance using SuperDesign, shadcn MCP, and modern design tools.

## Usage
```
/design-agent "Design brief or specific design request"
```

## Agent Capabilities
- **SuperDesign Workflow**: Guides through 4-phase design process
- **Component Integration**: Uses shadcn MCP for proper implementation
- **Theme Management**: Applies and customizes themes with TweakCN
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures modern design standards
- **Speckit Integration**: Works within project workflow system

## Example Commands

### New Design Project
```
/design-agent "Create a modern dashboard for a project management SaaS. Include navigation, task overview cards, progress charts, and team collaboration features. Target users are tech-savvy project managers."
```

### Design Iteration
```
/design-agent "I have a layout but need to improve the color scheme and add better visual hierarchy. The current design feels flat and doesn't guide the user's attention effectively."
```

### Component Conversion
```
/design-agent "Convert my SuperDesign prototype to shadcn components. The design includes a header with navigation, sidebar with filters, main content with card grid, and modal dialogs for actions."
```

### Theme Customization
```
/design-agent "Apply a professional dark theme to my existing design using TweakCN. Ensure good contrast and accessibility while maintaining the modern aesthetic."
```

### Responsive Design
```
/design-agent "Make my desktop design responsive for mobile and tablet. Focus on navigation patterns, card layouts, and touch-friendly interactions."
```

## Design Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Layout Design (10 min)
- Generate 3-5 layout iterations
- ASCII visualization for quick comparison
- Structure and component placement focus
- User flow consideration

### Phase 2: Theme Application (15 min)
- Color palette generation (colors.co)
- 5 theme variations (modern, professional, etc.)
- Design language consistency
- Accessibility compliance

### Phase 3: Interactive Implementation (10 min)
- Animation and transition design
- Hover and click effects
- Functional element implementation
- SuperDesign canvas testing

### Phase 4: Production Conversion (20 min)
- shadcn MCP component mapping
- Implementation planning
- Code generation
- TweakCN theme application

## Integration Features

### Speckit Workflow Integration
- Links to feature tracking system
- Updates progress in workflow dashboard
- Maintains design documentation
- Coordinates with development handoff

### Quality Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance-optimized animations
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Tool Ecosystem
- **SuperDesign**: Primary design canvas
- **shadcn MCP**: Component library context
- **TweakCN**: Theme customization
- **colors.co**: Palette generation
- **Animattopi**: Animation effects
- **Lucide**: Icon system

## Best Practices
1. Start with user needs and business goals
2. Focus on information architecture first
3. Design for accessibility from the beginning
4. Test interactions in SuperDesign canvas
5. Plan for component reusability
6. Document design decisions

## Error Prevention
- Validates color contrast ratios
- Checks responsive behavior
- Ensures component compatibility
- Tests animation performance
- Verifies accessibility standards

This command launches a comprehensive design workflow that integrates with your development process while ensuring high-quality, accessible, and maintainable front-end designs.
