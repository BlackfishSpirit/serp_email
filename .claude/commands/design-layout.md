# Design Layout Command

Create layout iterations using SuperDesign workflow with ASCII visualization for rapid prototyping.

## Usage
```
/design-layout "Create 5 layout iterations for [component/page description] using SuperDesign workflow. Use ASCII format for quick visualization."
```

## Process
1. Generate 3-5 different layout structures
2. Use ASCII format for quick visualization
3. Focus on component placement and structure
4. No styling or colors at this stage
5. Allow for easy modification requests

## Example Layouts
- Standard top navigation layout
- Side navigation with main content
- Split-screen designs
- Mobile-first responsive layouts
- Dashboard grid layouts

This command initiates the first phase of the SuperDesign workflow focusing purely on structural layout before moving to theming and implementation phases.
