# Merge main into your branch (choose one method)
git merge main
# OR
git rebase main
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

pnpm features:list
pnpm features:metrics
```

### Step 3: Check the Dashboard

# Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/dev/features
```

## ðŸš€ You're Ready!

The feature tracking system is now available with these commands:

### Basic Commands
```bash
pnpm features:list              # List all features
pnpm features:metrics          # Show project metrics
pnpm features:create "Name" "Description" --priority high
pnpm features:move feat-001 active
```

### Spec-Driven Development
```bash
# Create feature with GitHub Spec Kit integration
pnpm features:spec "Add user authentication system"
```
